## JetMP Integration (v1.0)

This plugin now includes an integrated system originally based on JetMP. The following features have been added on top of the existing Essentials functionality:

### Discord Integration
- Bot automatically starts with the server
- Real-time killfeed messages sent to a configured Discord channel
- Supports skin-based embeds using Minecraft avatar APIs
- Commands like `!playerinfo`, `!admininfo`, `!teaminfo`, `!topkills`, `!topteams`, and `!verify`

### Clan / Team System
- `/team create <name>`: Create a new team
- `/team join <name>`: Join an existing team
- `/team leave`: Leave your current team
- Teams are tracked in a SQLite database
- Scoreboard integration to show team, kills, and deaths

### Account Linking
- `/link`: Generates a code to link Minecraft and Discord account
- `!verify <code>`: Run in Discord to link accounts
- All links are stored in the local SQLite database

### SQLite Integration
- Auto-creates database file at `plugins/kEssentials/data.db`
- Manages player statistics, team data, and Discord linking

### Configurable Settings
- `config.json` file in plugin folder:
  - Bot token and Discord settings
  - Killfeed message format and embed style
  - Admin roles for protected commands
  - Customizable language for all messages

---

These additions were implemented without changing the original command structure of kEssentials, making the plugin fully backward compatible.
